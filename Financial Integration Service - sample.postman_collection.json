		"description": "**Introduction**\n\nThis collection will demonstrate how to use the Financial Integration Service API for pulling approved expense reports from SAP Concur and posting into your ERP. It allows for near real time bi-directional integration between the two applications.\n\nThe complete Financial Integration Service documentation [can be found here](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/financial-integration/v4.financial-integration.html).\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\nThis collection does not contain the necessary API calls needed for authentication with Concur. Please reference this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/concur-web-services-authentication) and/or [this post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/23/introduction-to-web-services-for-concur-expense-authentication/) for information on authentication methodology and the global variables used by this collection. The application SCOPEs required are:\n\n- FISVC\n    \n\n**Special Variables**\n\nWithin the collection there are 3 collection variables that are used:\n\n- doctype - the most common doctype is 'expense'. There are 4 other doctypes available and they can be substituted in as necessary.\n- docId - this is the document id of the _financial_ _document_ within Concur Expense. Normally there is one financial document per expense report however if a document fails to post and it is rejected in the Post FIS Confirmation (see below), when that expense report is resubmitted, it will create another _financial_ _document_.\n- reportID - this is a special variable that can be used to GET one expect report from within Concur.\n    \n\n**Detailed Description**\n\nThere are 8 data steps needed to to process an expense report. Assuming you have authenticated and obtained an access token, they are:\n\n1. Send a GET require to Concur Expense to request all expense reports that are fully approved and are waiting to post.\n    1. This is demonstrated by \"1 - Get FIS Transactions - All\"\n2. You receive a response from Concur with all the expense reports (there could be none waiting)\n3. Send an Acknowledgement to Concur that locks the expense report from being changed by Concur. This request could fail if the expense report was recalled back to the employee/processor. If that is the case, **do not post the expense report**.\n    1. This is demonstrated by \"3 - Post FIS Acknowledgement\"\n4. Try to post the expense report in your ERP\n5. Receive a response from the ERP that the posting worked, or it failed for some reason\n6. Send a Posting Confirmation to Concur Expense with the appropriate status (success/failure).\n    1. This is demonstrated by \"6s - Post FIS Confirmations - Success\" and \"6f - Post FIS Confirmations - Failure\"\n7. (optional) At some point in the future, you will receive and acknowledgement from your payment application (payroll, account payables, etc) that payment has been made for this expense report.\n8. (optional) Send a message to Concur Expense to update the status with the payment information.\n    1. This is demonstrated by \"8 - Post FIS Payment Confirmation\"\n\nThis postman collection will not provide examples for actual posting into your ERP as that is destination system specific.",
